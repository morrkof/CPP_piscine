#### Module 0 (Basic stuff: namespaces, classes, methods, streams)
Exercise 00: a program 'Megaphone' that change input to uppercase <br />
Exercise 01: a program 'Phonebook' with ADD, SEARCH and EXIT commands, that can store up to 8 contacts.
#### Module 1 (Memory allocation, references, pointers)
Exercise 00: Class on the heap, class on the stack <br />
Exercise 01: Fix memory leak <br />
Exercise 02: Creating Zombie on the heap with randomly generated names<br />
Exercise 03: Creating simple container ZombieHorde<br />
Exercise 04: Comparing reference and pointer (Brain class)<br />
Exercise 05: Work with references (Brain and Human with Brain)<br />
Exercise 06: Work with references and pointers (Humans and Weapons)<br />
Exercise 07: a program 'Replace', that accept two arguments, read file and replace all occurence of argument1 with argument2
#### Module 2 (Ad-hoc polymorphism, operator overloads)
Exercise 00: class for store fixed point numbers<br />
Exercise 01: add converting (to/from float) for fixed point number class
#### Module 3 (Inheritance)
Exercise 00: FragTrap class<br />
Exercise 01: ScavTrap class<br />
Exercise 02: ClapTrap class, now FragTrap and ScavTrap inherited from ClapTrap<br />
Exercise 03: NinjaTrap class inherited from ClapTrap<br />
Exercise 04: SuperTrap class, inherited from Ninja and Frag (Diamond inheritance)
#### Module 4 (Subtype polymorphism, abstract classes, interfaces)
Exercise 00: Sorcerer class, than can do a spell Polymorphism to his victims with different result<br />
Exercise 01: Character, Enemy, AWeapon classes with subclasses<br />
